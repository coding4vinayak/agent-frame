Example Agent Types (Replit just needs to understand what kind of work they do)

Data Agent

Connects to external APIs or databases

Cleans, transforms, or analyzes structured/unstructured data

Stores embeddings or results in a vector database (e.g. Qdrant, Pinecone, or PGVector)

Automation Agent

Executes scheduled or triggered workflows

Calls APIs, sends emails, or automates repetitive backend tasks

Logs results and resource usage metrics

Insight Agent

Summarizes reports or generates insights from text/data

Uses an LLM only when needed (lightweight call)

Outputs results to dashboards

Monitoring Agent

Monitors API performance, user usage, and system metrics

Sends alerts or reports to admin panel

🔹 How the System Will Work

Frontend (React or Next.js built on Replit)

Clean, modular UI (no CRM look)

Includes:

Login / Org setup

Admin Dashboard (manage users, metrics, usage, and attached agents)

Placeholder section: “Agent Board” — where each agent has a visual card/block

Backend (FastAPI or Flask + Postgres)

Multi-tenant structure (each organization has isolated data)

Role-based Access Control (Super Admin, Org Admin, User)

Metrics tracking (API calls, agent usage, compute time)

Integration-ready endpoints for vector DBs

Modular system to register and invoke new AI agents later

Database (Postgres)

Tables for users, organizations, roles, usage_metrics, agent_registry

Agent metadata: type, API endpoints, resource consumption, etc.

Vector Database (future integration)

Used only by AI agents that need semantic search or embedding lookups

Stored separately from main Postgres tables

Backend should provide a clean connector (example: pgvector or Qdrant API)

Testing / QA Setup

Automated tests for API endpoints

Load tests for multi-tenancy

Mock data for simulating agents

💡 Key Design Directives for Replit

✅ Use React + Tailwind or Next.js + ShadCN for a modern clean UI

✅ Use FastAPI + Postgres backend

✅ Prepare hooks / endpoints / tables for future AI agent integration

✅ Include admin, super admin, user roles

✅ Include organization-level multi-tenancy

✅ Keep UI minimal, modular, and non-CRM-like

✅ Include testing files and API documentation
