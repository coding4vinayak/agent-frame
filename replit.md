## 🔐 Multi-Tenant Security (Critical)

**All Backend Agents MUST**:
1. Filter all queries by `org_id`
2. Validate JWT tokens on every request
3. Never expose data across organizations
4. Encrypt sensitive data (API keys, customer data)
5. Implement rate limiting per organization
6. Audit log all actions

**Example (Python)**:
```python
class FormCollectionAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def execute(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Always validate org_id
        if not self.validate_org_access(input_data['form_id'], 'forms'):
            return {"success": False, "error": "Access denied"}
        
        # Process only org-specific data
        submissions = self.get_submissions_by_org(self.org_id)
        # ...
```
